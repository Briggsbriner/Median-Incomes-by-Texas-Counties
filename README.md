# **Median Incomes in Texas Counties**
Unit 3 Project for English 105
The original Public Health dataset was provided by Professor Gotzler

In this repository, you will find a Colab notebook outlining specific steps on how to cull a condensed dataset, a larger public health by county dataset, and ultimately the subset of data I sifted to create the subset about median household incomes across various counties in Texas.


### **Why Does This Data Matter?**
This dataset is useful because it can be used to analyze socioeconomic differences across counties in Texas, which can be helpful to reveal disparities in income and wealth which vary by county. Furthermore, researchers can use this data to understand the income inequality between counties to assess factors that could possibly cause this discrepancy in incomes. Finally, with this data policymakers could understand these disparities in Texas and could formulate policies tailored to specific regions to address inequalities. 

### **User Experience and Overview**
I encourage all users to look around the data and potentially use the data in their own research. To view the larger data set, go to the data folder and download the file named "CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv". After viewing the larger data set, there is also the condensed data set I made by sorting through the larger set of data. This sorted data I brought together is a file in the data folder called “Medianincomestx.csv”.  


### **How Was This Data Collected**
To see the transition from the larger data set to the smaller data set, look in the “process flow” folder and there you will locate a file called “Briner_Notebook-2.ipynb”. This notebook is the detailed instruction manual on how I culled the data from the file “Medianincomestx.csv”from the larger dataset called "CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv".
