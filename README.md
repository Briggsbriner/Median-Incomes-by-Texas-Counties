# Median-Incomes-Texas-Counties
Unit 3 Project for English 105

### What does this dataset provide?
This dataset provides condensed and sorted through data from the larger dataset that depicts median income by county within Texas which could be beneficial for research. 

### Why is the data in this repository useful?
This dataset is useful because it can be used to analyze socioeconomic differences across counties in Texas, which can be helpful to reveal disparities in income and wealth which vary by county. Furthermore, researchers can use this data to understand the income inequality between counties to assess factors that could possibly cause this discrepancy in incomes. Finally, with this data policymakers could understand these disparities in Texas and could formulate policies tailored to specific regions to address inequalities. 

### User experiance and overview
Users can start in the repository by viewing the larger data set located in the data folder. After viewing the larger data set they can view the smaller dataset titled “Medianincomestx.csv”. Then to see the transition from the larger data set to the smaller data, look in the “process flow” folder and there you will locate a file called “Briner_Notebook-2.ipynb”. This notebook is the detailed instruction manual on how I ascertained my specific data set.
